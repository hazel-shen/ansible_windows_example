# This is Ansible example for Windows

![Ansible Automation Platform](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/workshops/master/images/rh-ansible-automation-platform.png)

I will set up series of example code and cconfiguration for introducing how to use ansible to control the windows node.

Also, the step by step with pictures will be posted on [My Blog](https://hazel.style).
Feel free to send this repo PR and let me know your ideas.
